# Tests Directory

This folder contains unit tests for all features. Each test file mirrors the structure of the main app for easy discoverability and maintenance.

- Each module/feature has at least:
  - 1 test for expected use
  - 1 edge case
  - 1 failure case

To run all tests:

```bash
npm test
```
